# .gitignore defines files to ignore and remain untracked in Git
# Each line in a gitignore file specifies a pattern, eg. directory or file extension

# Git should not track binary artifacts such as images, libraries, executables, archive files etc.
# Until the team has mature processes, a Binary Artifacts Repository Manager is not in use.

# Therefore some binary artifacts are tracked in this Git repository


# Further .gitignore templates available at:
